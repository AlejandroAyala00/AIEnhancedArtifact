# üìò Business Continuity Quick-Start Guide

A **step-by-step guide** for small to mid-sized organizations to prepare for unexpected disruptions (cyberattacks, system outages, natural disasters).  
This resource provides a lightweight framework that can be adopted quickly while aligning with best practices in **Business Continuity Planning (BCP)** and **Disaster Recovery (DR)**.

---

## üöÄ Purpose
Business continuity ensures that critical business functions can continue during and after a disruption.  
This guide is designed as a **starting point** ‚Äî not a full ISO 22301 implementation ‚Äî but it covers the essentials any organization should have in place.

---

## üß© Steps to Follow

### 1. Identify Critical Systems
- List your organization‚Äôs essential functions (e.g., payroll, email, website, customer service).  
- Rank them by importance: **High / Medium / Low**.  
- Document dependencies (hardware, software, vendors).

---

### 2. Backup Data Daily
- Ensure automatic backups are enabled for all critical systems.  
- Store backups in **two locations**:  
  - Local (external drive, on-premise server).  
  - Offsite/Cloud (AWS S3, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).  
- Test restoring backups at least **once per quarter**.

---

### 3. Define Recovery Objectives
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** How fast should systems be restored? (e.g., payroll must be back in 24 hrs).  
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** How much data loss is acceptable? (e.g., no more than 4 hrs of transactions).  
- Document these objectives for each system.

---

### 4. Train Staff With a Test Drill
- Run at least **1 test per year** simulating an outage.  
- Assign roles (who calls vendors, who communicates with employees, who restores systems).  
- Record lessons learned and update the plan.

---

### 5. Document Emergency Contacts
- Maintain an up-to-date contact list including:  
  - IT staff  
  - Critical vendors  
  - Utility providers  
  - Leadership team  
- Store this list **offline** (printed copies in secure locations).
