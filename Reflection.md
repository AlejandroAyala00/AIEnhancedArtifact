# Reflection on AI Use

## How AI Was Used
- I used ChatGPT to help brainstorm project ideas that could be completed in one day and still deliver meaningful business value.  
- AI was used to draft the **Business Continuity Quick-Start Guide**, including step-by-step instructions, table templates, and wording aligned with professional standards.  
- I also used AI to refine the tone and clarity of the guide so it would be polished and employer-ready.

## What Worked Well
- AI saved significant time in **research and drafting**. Instead of starting from a blank page, I was able to get a structured outline in minutes.  
- The AI provided examples (like the filled-out table template and recovery objectives) that gave the guide a more **complete and realistic feel**.  
- The suggestions for GitHub structure and commit practices helped make the project look more **professional and portfolio-worthy**.

## What Didn’t Work
- Some of the AI’s initial ideas were **too ambitious for a 7-day project** (e.g., building a forecasting dashboard or coding a full IT tool). These needed to be scaled back to fit the scope.  
- Certain sections generated by AI were **too generic** at first. I had to refine and adapt the content to focus on practical, actionable steps that a real business could use.  
- AI occasionally added unnecessary detail that could overwhelm the quick-start purpose, so I had to cut or simplify.

## Lessons Learned
- **AI is best used as a co-pilot**: it accelerates drafting, brainstorming, and editing, but human judgment is required to keep the project realistic and business-focused.  
- For portfolio work, AI can provide a strong foundation, but the real value comes from how I **curate, polish, and present** the deliverable.  
- This exercise reinforced that effective CIS professionals must know how to leverage AI efficiently while still ensuring technical accuracy and practical applicability.
